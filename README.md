The phpBB Topic Prefixes extension allows phpBB board administrators to create topic prefix tags that users can easily add to their topic titles. Features include:

- Create unique and unlimited prefixes for each forum in your phpBB board.
- Prefix tags can be sorted, enabled or disabled.
- Users will see a topic prefix menu when creating a new topic in a forum that uses topic prefixes.
- Topic prefixes can easily be changed when a user is editing their original forst post.
- Because the topic prefix is added directly to the topic title, if an admin disables or deletes a forum's topic prefix, existing topic titles using the deleted prefix will not be changed.
- This is the same extension currently in use at phpbb.com in the Extensions and Styles in development forums.
